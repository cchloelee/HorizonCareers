    <p>Before you apply for a job, it is essential to first start writing out a resume for prospective jobs that you are applying for, as they demonstrate your professional demeanor in the workplace, add to your first impression on your employer, and provide useful background information about you that can boost your chances of getting the job. </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>What is a resume?</h2>
    <p>Your resume, usually only one to two pages in length, provides a summary of your experiences and qualifications for jobs you are applying for. This may include anything from your education and work history to personal qualities and strengths that you have. It is a sort of “self-advertisement” to further sell yourself as a qualified worker, making a first impression and letting employers know a little about yourself before a potential job interview. If you have never seen a resume before, click here to see a few examples.</p>
<p>In general, prospective job seekers send their resumes for employers to look at to consider them for a potential interview for the job. You can also submit your resume to various job websites, so that job recruiters can regularly browse your qualifications and call you if they think that you are especially qualified for a job they have in mind.
Of course, for some jobs, you may be able to directly apply without needing to submit a resume. If your employers do not ask for your resume beforehand, however, you can always give them a copy of your resume at the job interview, so that your employer has a more detailed and complete picture of who you are. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Build your resume:</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Preparation</h3>
<h4>Brainstorm accomplishments, activities, and personal strengths you would like to highlight to a future employer
</h4>
<p>To start on building your resume, first figure out what you would like to put on: sit down somewhere and write down all of your life experiences. Then, sort them out into its basic categories: education, work experience, volunteer experience, awards and honors and organize them onto a separate page.
</p>
<p>If you would like to include other information about yourself, you can also add a “skills” or “personal qualities” section of the resume, below the other categories. In addition, if you are applying to a specific job, you may also want to write a purpose statement as to why you are applying or a brief summary of yourself at the top.
<h4>Choose your resume format</h4>
<p>Prior to entering your personal information onto a resume template or any document, first plan out what resume format you would like to have. There are a myriad of resume types, such as chronological, functional, combination, and targeted, which place different emphasis on the variety of categories of resume information. Of course, if you feel like none of these formats suits you, feel free to either combine or mix them together or formulate your own format of organizing information yourself. </p>
<p>Chronological resumes, the most commonly used and basic type of resume, lists your work history and other experiences and awards in chronological order, with the most recent being at the top and least recent work at the bottom.
</p>
<p>Functional resumes tend to focus on one’s experiences outside of work and skills first. Unlike chronological resumes, specific dates and work history are less emphasized. If you have not had held a job before and are still in school, you can always include extracurricular involvement and volunteer experience here.
</p>
<p>Combination resumes mix the elements of chronological and functional resumes: both work history and skills and experience are equally featured to the employer. If your experiences, skills, and work history, align well, you can use this type of resume to really tell a coherent and cohesive story about your career path to your employer.
</p>
<p>Targeted resumes specifically aim to fit the description of a certain job or position. The information in these types of resumes, which can include anything from a job objective to personal strengths, are tailored to mirror a job’s requirements and qualifications.
</p>
<h4>Organize your information</h4>
<p>After choosing your resume format, it’s time to start organizing the information you would like to include accordingly. Rank your brainstormed information chronologically, or from most to least important, on a separate document or sheet of paper. Then, you can officially begin writing your resume.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Part 2: Writing</h3>
<h4>Browse example resumes or find an online template </h4>
<p>The best way to begin actually formulating your resume is to see examples or to enter in your personal information in a resume template. Click here to see example resumes for inspiration, each with their own pros and cons. In general, try to keep you resume simple and concise, so that it looks professional and is an easy read for employers.
</p>
<p>The example resumes are also downloadable, so you can find which formats you like the most and use them as resume templates. Simply change the basic information in the examples with your personal information. If none of the templates fits your personal style, you can always look up templates online, on various resume websites, as well. Sites such as the Muse, the Balance, and Monster have plenty of different templates to choose from.
</p>
<h4>Enter in information based on the jobs you are applying for </h4>
<p>Based on the type of resume you choose, enter in all relevant information that you brainstormed earlier and would like employers to know about. Make sure that you summarize all of your information concisely and clearly - no one wants to read repetitive information, especially employers, who may be going over dozens of resumes a day.
</p>
<h3>Part 3: Polishing</h3>
<h4>Format your resume information</h4>
<p>When you are finished with the meat of your resume, there will still be a little bit of polishing needed to attract employers to it.
</p>
<p>First of all, try the very hardest to limit your resume to one page. If not, keep it at two maximum. Most likely, there will be activities or experiences that you have included in it that may not be very impressive or relevant to the job you are applying for. If you are not proud of anything you have put in your resume or do not think it will help, just take it off and favor the brevity.
</p>
<p>As for fonts, aim to keep them as simple as possible and as legible as possible. Don’t make your employers strain at too flowery or small font. Although you name and other headers should be considerably larger, a solid font size for the bulk of your resume is anywhere from 10 to 12, while example fonts you can use are Times New Roman, Cambria, or Calibri.
</p>
<p>Check that all elements of your resume are cohesive. This would mean that you have the same font throughout and same sizes per type of information (i.e. 50 for headers, 11 for experiences and skills). Double check that how you format your dates and descriptions are the same, such as including only years for all work history, or bolding all company names.
</p>
<h4>Proofread and check your resume</h4>
<p>Here is a basic checklist of information you should include in your resume:
</p>
<p>- Identification: Your name at the top; contact information - phone number, email, etc.; address
</p>
<p>- Experience: summary of accomplishments, responsibilities, jobs or other positions held before
</p>
<p>- Education</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on what job you are applying for and what resume format you intend to use, there should be some other information included in your resume as well.

In addition, make sure that you have no grammar or spelling errors and that all of your information is accurate and can be backed up by other people.

</p>
<h4>Ask others to look over your resume </h4>
<p>After you first proofread and polish your resume, ask friends, family, or other professionals you are acquainted with to read over your resume and to give you tips on how it improve it. Chances are, they already have ample experience writing and seeing resumes and will not be short of advice on how you can better it and seem the most qualified to employers. In addition, they know your personal background and traits and may be able to offer qualities and accomplishments that you haven’t thought of to put on your resume.
