      <h2>What is a resume?</h2>
      <p>Your resume, usually only one to two pages in length, provides a summary of your experiences and qualifications for jobs you are applying for. This may include anything from your education and work history to personal qualities and strengths that you have. It is a sort of “self-advertisement” to further sell yourself as a qualified worker, making a first impression and letting employers know a little about yourself before a potential job interview. If you have never seen a resume before, click here to see a few examples.</p>
  <p>In general, prospective job seekers send their resumes for employers to look at to consider them for a potential interview for the job. You can also submit your resume to various job websites, so that job recruiters can regularly browse your qualifications and call you if they think that you are especially qualified for a job they have in mind.
  Of course, for some jobs, you may be able to directly apply without needing to submit a resume. If your employers do not ask for your resume beforehand, however, you can always give them a copy of your resume at the job interview, so that your employer has a more detailed and complete picture of who you are. </p>
