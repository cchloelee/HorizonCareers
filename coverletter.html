      <blockquote class="quote-intro lead">Cover letters are one page documents that one would send alone with a resume when applying for a job. Cover letters are meant for introducing yourself to a company and to show why you would be the perfect applicant! Your cover letter can highlight specific skills that are unique to you and explains why you are well-suited for the job.</blockquote>

      <h2>To get started:</h2>
      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Start with a hello! Introduce yourself to the reader. Have some sort of salutation and somehow find a name to send your letter to. Yes, that means stalking their company’s facebook, linkedin, or website to find someone to refer to and send your letter to that one specific important person in that company. A hiring manager will pay more attention to someone who starts off with “Dear Mr./Ms. Name” rather than “to whoever it may concern…”
</p>
  <p>This is what your interviewer sees first. Get their attention. They want to see what you can do for them. For example, instead of starting with “I’m applying for” like every single applicant does, start with something that is unique to you like “After working with Google, designing several logos for major companies such as Apple, and graduating from Harvard, I am writing to express my interest in [name of position].” This immediately shows the interviewer how qualified you are and will impress the interviewer as well! </p>
  </div>
<h3>Letter Content</h3>
<p>Below is a basic checklist of information you should include in your letter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your name</li>
<li>The job you're applying for</li>
<li>Address/contact information</li>
<li>Respectful start to the letter (i.e. Dear [name]) </li>
<li>An ending that causes a bang! </li>
</ol>
